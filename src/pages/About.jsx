        Hey there,
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I'm Aileen. I'm interested in designing meaningful experiences that shape how we interact with technology.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I'm currently designing experiences to make Amazon a better place to discover and research products.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Previously, I studied Communication Design at BTK Berlin, where I wrote my thesis on the effects of biases in design. Before that, I worked with brands to create digital products at Edenspiekermann. I also helped improve Tumblr's posting experience on mobile and helped General Assembly launch a new online course.
        I spend my time taking photos, drawing, and exploring places. Other times, I'm working on becoming a better speaker.
